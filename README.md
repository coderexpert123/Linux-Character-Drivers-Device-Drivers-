# Character Device Driver README

## Overview
This project implements a simple Linux character device driver that creates a `/proc` file named `hello_proc`. The driver allows users to read a message from kernel space through the `/proc` filesystem.

## Features
- **Reads from `/proc/hello_proc`:** When accessed, the driver returns the message "ACk\n".
- **Kernel logging:** The driver logs messages to the kernel log for debugging purposes.

## Prerequisites
- A Linux environment with kernel development headers installed.
- The necessary permissions to load kernel modules.

## Architecture Compatibility
The provided character device driver code is primarily designed for the **x86** architecture but can be adapted to work on other architectures supported by the Linux kernel, such as:
- **x86_64**
- **ARM**
- **MIPS**
  
While the code is generally compatible, minor modifications may be necessary depending on the specific environment. Always ensure you have the appropriate kernel headers and test the driver on the intended architecture.

## Files
- `ldd.c`: The source code for the character device driver.
- `Makefile`: The makefile for building the driver.
- `user_app.py`: A simple user application to read from the `/proc/hello_proc` file.

## Building the Module
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Build the module:**
   ```bash
   make
   ```

   This will compile the `ldd.c` file and create the kernel module.

## Loading the Module
To load the module into the kernel, use the following command:
```bash
sudo insmod ldd.ko
```

To verify that the module has been loaded successfully, check the kernel log:
```bash
dmesg | tail
```

## Accessing the Proc File
You can read from the `/proc/hello_proc` file using the provided Python script or through the command line.

### Using the User Application
To read from the `/proc/hello_proc` file, run the user application:
```bash
python3 user_app.py
```

### Command Line Access
Alternatively, you can read from the file directly using `cat`:
```bash
cat /proc/hello_proc
```

## Unloading the Module
To remove the module from the kernel, use the following command:
```bash
sudo rmmod ldd
```

Check the kernel log to confirm that the module has been removed:
```bash
dmesg | tail
```

## Code Explanation
- **Kernel Module Initialization (`custom_drv_init`)**: Creates a proc entry and logs initialization messages.
- **Read Function (`nishant_read`)**: Handles read requests from the proc file, copying the message to user space.
- **Module Exit (`custom_drv_exit`)**: Cleans up by removing the proc entry.
